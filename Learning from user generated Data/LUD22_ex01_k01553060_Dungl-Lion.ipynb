    "## Recommendation Scenario\n",
    "Imagine a platform where users consume items: buy goods (Amazon), listen to music tracks (Deezer, Spotify), watch movies (Netflix) or videos (YouTube).\n",
    "\n",
    "At some point a user may face a choice: \"what item should I have a look at next?\" Can be that they don't know what exactly they need and cannot formulate a query. Of course with catalogs of millions of items they have little chance finding something useful by browsing through all of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In such situation Recommender Systems are expected to make the decision easier for the user by shrinking the scope to a handful of individually selected options, for example top 10 recommended songs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Information the recommendation can be based on:\n",
    "* Items already consumed by the user\n",
    "* Items consumed by other users\n",
    "* User relations\n",
    "* Item meta-data & content\n",
    "* ...\n",
    "\n",
    "User-Item interactions is one of the most widely used signals in recommendation. Initially it can be available in a form of system logs (see table below). There is a multitude of ways a user can interact with an item: consume (buy, watch, listen), note (like, save to favorites), share and other. In this exercise we only deal with item consumption.\n",
