# 07 Regex
###############################################################################

#
# Task 1
#

# You are given a string "some_header". Use a regex to extract the ID-value,
# that is the content of the line starting with "# id: " but without the
# "# id: ". Regex can also match "\n" characters, so can search for some
# pattern that starts with "# id: " and ends with "\n".

some_header = """
# alpha: 55
# beta: 62
# some stuff
# id: A523B
# some stuff
"""

# Result should be:
# "A523B"

# Your code here #
import re
# This regex will match a string starting with " id:", followed by any number
# of white space characters " *", and any number of characters "(.*)" followed
# by a "\n". It will return as group 1 the characters in the group "(.*)".
pattern = "# id: *(.*)\n"
matchobject = re.search(pattern, some_header)
result = {matchobject.group(1)}
print(f'{result}')


#
# Task 2
#

# You are given a string "some_string". In the string there are 2 words that
# are separated by any number of whitespace characters. Extract the two words
# in the string without the whitespace characters and put them in a list
# "words".

some_string = "first_word          second_word"

# Result should be:
# words = ["first_word", "second_word"]

# Your code here #
import re
# This regex will match a string starting with any number larger than 0 of
# characters "(.+?)", followed by any number larger than 0 of white space
# characters " +",
# followed by any number larger than 0 of characters "(.+)".
# Since we make "(.*?)" non-greedy and strings are scanned from start to end,
# we will search for the shortest string followed by whitespace characters.
# After that the " +" pattern will match as many whitespace characters as it
# can (because it is greedy). Finally, "(.+)" will collect all other
# characters after the whitespace characters.
pattern = "(.+?) +(.+)"

print(f'{words}')


#
# Task 3
#

# You are given a list of strings "some_strings". In each string there are 2
# words that are separated by any number of whitespace characters. Extract
# the two words for each string in the list.
# Create 2 lists, "first_words" and "second_words" that each contain the
# collected first and second words.
