# Functions
###############################################################################
# Functions can be used to create re-usable parts of code. Python functions
# should have lower case names, optionally take arguments, and are created
# with the "def" keyword and the syntax
# def function_name(arguments):
#     code in function
#     return returned-variables

# This would be a function that takes no arguments, computes 3*5, converts the
# result to a string and returns it:
def no_arguments():
    a = 3 * 5
    a = str(a)
    return a


# We can then call this function whenever we need it:
result = no_arguments()
another_result = no_arguments()


# Note that variables created inside a function only exist inside the function!
def add(a, b):
    # This code is executed when calling the function. Variables created here
    # are not available outside of the function.
    c = a + b  # This variable "c" exists only within this function
    return c

# Arguments can be passed to functions using keyword-arguments:
result = add(b=2, a=1)

# Or using positional arguments (following the position of the arguments in
# the function definition):
result = add(1, 2)

# Or a mix of both - as long as the positional arguments are in front:
result = add(1, b=2)

# If you do not want to make use of the returned values, use an underscore:
_ = add(1, 2)

# The variable "c" in the function does only exist within the function, so
# we can use a another different variable with the same name outside the
# function:
c = 15
print(f"c before function: {c}")
# This will not alter the variable c outside the function:
result = add(b=2, a=1)
print(f"c after function: {c}")


#
# Function arguments
#


# You can assign default values to the arguments and make them optional:
def add(a, b=1):  # we set a default value of 1 for argument b
    c = a + b
    return c


result = add(1)


# You may use colons to indicate the type of the arguments (this is only
# and indication and does not force anything!)
def add(a: int, b: int = 1):
    c = a + b
    return c


# This still works but PyCharm warns us about an integer being expected:
result = add(1, 2.123)


# Make use of docstrings to show what your function is about:
def add(a: int, b: int = 1):
    """Adding two variables (small description)

    This function adds two variables via the + operator. (long description)

    Parameters
    -------------
    a : int
        First argument
    b : int
        Second argument

    Returns
    -------------
    int
        Returns a+b
    """
    c = a + b
    return c


# Left-click on the function "add" and Ctrl+q or go to View->QuickDocumentation
# to display the information in the docstring as documentation in PyCharm

# If you do not know how many arguments you will get, you can use *arg to collect
# all positional arguments and **kwargs to collect all keyword arguments.
# If no return statement is used, None is returned by default.
def unknown_arguments(*args, **kwargs):
    print(f"Function got args: {args}")
    print(f"Function got kwargs: {kwargs}")


unknown_arguments(1, 2, 3, a=4, b=5, c=6)


# If you want to pass list or dictionary elements to a function as separated
# arguments, you can use * or ** respectively to unpack the values

    c = a + b

#
# Function return values
#

# Returning a value is optional in Python functions. If you do not return
# anything, None will be returned. If you return multiple values, they are
# packed into a tuple:
def return_values():
    return 1, 2, 3, 4


# Here we just leave the return values as a tuple:
result_tuple = return_values()
# But we can also unpack the values:
a, b, c, d = return_values()
# Or we can unpack only the first values and leave the rest as list
# using *listname:
first, second, *others = return_values()


#
# Recursions
#

# Functions are allowed to call themselves recursively
def add(*args):
    """This function adds up any arbitrary number of arguments recursively"""
    a = args[0]
    if len(args[1:]) == 1:
        b = args[1]
    else:
        b = add(args[1], *args[2:])
    c = a + b
    return c


# If you pass a list to the function the contents of the list are not copied!
# Instead, the list is treated as reference, so if you index the list or use
# in-place functions you get access to the element that is also used by the
# list outside the function. The same goes for dictionaries.
# Note how the example below changes the list elements also outside of the
# function:
def modlist(somelist):
    somelist[0] = 55


mylist = [1, 2, 3]
modlist(mylist)  # this changes the first element in list mylist!

        yield a

# Printing to and reading from console
###############################################################################
# print() can be used to print one or multiple objects to the console

# Modules
###############################################################################

#
# Importing modules
#

# You can import existing modules (=python files, classes, functions) via
# the import ... or import ... as ... statement. Afterwards you can use its
# contents. With this, the full module will be imported.
import os
correct_path = os.path.join("'some', 'directory'")

# Many python modules have suggested nicknames, You can choose a different
# name of the imported module using the 'as' keyword:
import sys as system
encoding_in_this_python = system.getdefaultencoding()

# Use from ... import ... to only import a specific part of a module
from os import path
numpy_array = path.join("'some', 'directory'")

# You can import multiple modules with one statement using commas
import os, sys
from os import path, makedirs

# If you import a module multiple times, python will usually not import it anew


#
# Creating and using custom modules
#

# If you want to reuse content from your own files, you can simply import it
# from there. Always make sure that the PYTHONPATH is set correctly or the
# module is within your working directory. Python will search within the
# PYTHONPATH and the working directory for the module.

# The following line imports function 'add' from file "my_module.py" and
# assigns it the name 'my_add'
from my_module import add as my_add

argument_list = list(range(10))
print(my_add(*argument_list))

# When importing from a file, the content of the file will be executed. Often
# we want to include code that should only be executed when using the
# file as main file (= execution only when calling the file but not when
# importing from it). This can be done using the following syntax:

print("This code will be executed when this file is imported")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print("This code will not be executed when this file is imported")

# You can check the example in my_module.py by executing my_module.py directly

# You can access directories as "classes" to import files from by placing an
# empty __init__.py file in the directory. (See exercise 05_classes.py later.)
