# Classes
###############################################################################
# As we have seen with functions, the ability to effectively re-use code can
# benefit the program design. Object-oriented programming tries to achieve a
# higher level of reusability and modularity based on the idea of "objects".
# Such objects can hold data (referred to as "fields", "attributes", or
# "properties") and procedures/functions (referred to as "methods").

# In Python this concept is applied using "classes" to create a class of an
# object, e.g. the class "Dog", and "instances", which are an object instance
# from the class, e.g. an instance of "Dog" with name "bello" and another
# instance of "Dog" with name "barky".

# Classes are defined via the "class" statement. Class names should use
# CamelCase format. Instances of classes should use lower_case format.
# Tutorial: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html


#
# Creating a class and instances
#

# Let's create a class "Dog":
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name):
        """The __init__ method will be executed at instantiation of the class.
        As all class-functions, it has to take the 'self' object at first
        argument. 'self' will give us access to the attributes and methods
        within the instance.
        """
        # Objects defined within the functions of the class are only
        # available in the function scope (like a normal variable in a
        # function)
        some_variable = 5  # this variable exists only within this function
        
        # ...but they can be made available by turning them into attributes.
        # The syntax for creating an attribute is self.varname = var:
        self.name = name  # Create an attribute "self.name"
        
        print(f"Created {self.name}")


# We can now create instances of our Dog class:
dog_1 = Dog(name='bello')  # This will create an instance of our class

# We can now access the instance and its attributes:
print(f"dog_1: {dog_1}")
print(f"dog_1.name: {dog_1.name}")

# We can create another instance of our Dog class:
dog_2 = Dog(name='barky')  # This will create an instance of our class

# We can now access the instance and its attributes:
print(f"dog_2: {dog_2}")
print(f"dog_2.name: {dog_2.name}")

# Note that dog_1 and dog_2 are not the same object. They are 2 different
# instances:
print(f"dog_1 is dog_2? answer: {dog_1 is dog_2}")


# We can also add methods to our class. For example, we can add a function
# "communicate()":
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name):
        """The __init__ method will be executed at instantiation of the class.
        As all class-functions, it has to take the 'self' object at first
        argument. 'self' will give us access to the attributes and methods
        within the instance.
        """
        self.name = name  # Create an attribute "self.name"
    
    def communicate(self):
        """Here we defined another function available through the class
        instances. Note that the 'self' object has to be the first function-
        argument again. Functions of instances are called 'methods'. We can
        call the method later using the instance."""
        # Let's say we want the dog to bark:
        communication = "bark"
        # ... and we also want to include the name of the dog into the
        # communication. For this we can access the self.name attribute
        # that we created:
        communication = f"{self.name}: {communication}"
        return communication


# We can now again create instances of our new Dog class:
dog_1 = Dog(name='bello')  # This will create an instance of our class
dog_2 = Dog('barky')  # This will create another instance of our class

# We can now access the methods the same way we accessed the attributes:
print(dog_1.communicate())
print(dog_2.communicate())

#
# Inheritance
#

# Let's say we also want to add a class "Cat" and "Frog", that also have an
# attribute "name" and a method "communicate". However, we want to change what
# the communicate method does for "Cat" and "Frog". To do this, we can make use
# of "inheritance".


# First we define a base class that we call "Animal":
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        """The __init__ method will be executed at instantiation of the class.
        As all class-functions, it has to take the 'self' object at first
        argument. 'self' will give us access to the attributes and methods
        within the instance.
        """
        self.name = name  # Create an attribute "self.name"
    
    def communicate(self):
        """Returns the animal communication as string."""
        # We assume that the animal can make some noise:
        communication = "some noise"
        # ... and we again want to include the name of the animal into the
        # communication:
        communication = f"{self.name}: {communication}"
        return communication


# Then we can define a class "Dog" that inherits from the class "Animal". By
# doing this we will have a class "Dog" that contains the same attributes and
# methods as the base class "Animal" does. If we want to add or modify the
# methods/attributes we can simply overwrite them:
class Dog(Animal):

        communication = f"{self.name}: {communication}"
        return communication


# We can now again create and use instances of our classes Dog, Cat, and Frog
# that were all derived from the class Animal:

animal_2 = Cat(name='scratchy')
animal_3 = Frog(name='jumper')

print(animal_1.communicate())

# Recap: Directories as classes

# Adding a file "__init__.py" to a folder will make Python recognize the folder
# as "class" and you can import from it.
