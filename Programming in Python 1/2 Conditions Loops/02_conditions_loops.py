# Code blocks and indentation
###############################################################################
# Python uses indentation to form blocks of code and statements, in contrast to
# e.g. {} in other languages. Indentation can be done via tabs or spaces. It is
# common to use 4 spaces (in most editors this is the default or you can set
# tab to equal 4 spaces).
# Example:
# block 1
# block 1
    # block 2
    # block 2
    # block 2
        # block 3
        # block 3
    # block 2
        # block 4
        # block 4
    # block 2
# block 1
# block 1
    # block 5
    # block 5
# block 1
# block 1

# Comparisons
###############################################################################
# We already saw that we need boolean values as conditions to decide which
# parts of code to execute in the if-elif-else statements. Comparisons in
# Python allow us to compare two objects and return a boolean value. You can
# use comparisons on objects of different datatypes.

# Let us assume we have two variables a and b that refer to float objects:
a = 1.
b = 2.

# There are 8 comparison operations in Python:
equal = a == b  # Check if a and b have equal values
larger = a > b  # Check if a larger than b
larger_equal = a >= b  # Check if a larger than or equal to b
lesser = a < b  # Check if a lesser than b
lesser_equal = a <= b  # Check if a lesser than or equal to b
same_object = a is b  # Check if a and b refer to same object
not_same_object = a is not b  # Check if a and b do not refer to same object
# Important: '==' will compare the numerical value of objects, 'is' will
# compare the objects themselves!

# Numerical values of 1 and 1. are equal even if they have different datatypes
is_equal = 1 == 1.
# ... but int 1 and float 1. are not the same object
is_not_same_object = 1 is 1.

# Boolean True defaults to numerical 1 and False to numerical 0. Any numerical
# value other than 0 defaults to True if used as boolean:
is_equal = 1 == True  # Is True since numerical values are equal
is_equal = 1 is True  # Is False since objects are not the same
is_equal = False > 2.3  # Is False since 0 is not greater than 2.3

# You can chain comparisons using boolean operations like "and" or "or".
# "and" will be True if and only if both of the two statements that it combines
# evaluate to True:
is_true = True and True
is_false = True and False
is_false = False and False

# "or" will be True if and only if one or both of the two statements that it
# combines evaluate to True:
is_true = True or True
is_true = True or False
is_false = False or False

# The priority of comparisons is higher than that of boolean operations but lower
# than mathematical operators:
is_true = 1 == True and 1 == 1.
is_true = (1 == True) and (1 == 1.)  #  Is the same as "1 == True and 1 == 1."
is_true = (1 == True) and True  #  Is the same as "1 == True and True"
is_true = (1 > -4) and (1 is 1)
is_true = (1 > -4) and (1 is 1) and (1 < 4)
is_false = (1 > -4) and not (1 < 4)

# You can also chain comparisons without "and" or "or":
is_true = 1 < 4 <= 5  # Is the same as "1 < 4 and 4 <= 5"

# All non-numerical objects support the "==" and "!=" operator, which is then
# equivalent to "is" and "is not".
is_false = () == []  # Is equivalent to "() is []"
is_true = dict() != []  # Is equivalent to "dict() is not []"

# Other comparison operators are only supported by non-numerical objects
# "if they make sense". E.g. you can use them on strings:
is_true = 'abc' == 'abc'
is_true = 'abc' >= ''
is_true = 'abc' >= 'a'
is_true = 'abc' >= 'ab'
is_true = 'abc' >= 'abc'
is_false = 'abc' >= 'abd'
is_false = 'abc' >= 'abd'

# Here we combine comparisons and if-elif-else statements:
a = 2
b = 3
if a > b:
    print('a > b !')
elif a < b:
    print('a < b !')
elif a == b:
    print('a == b !')
else:
    print('How did I get here?')

# for loops
###############################################################################
# For loops in python iterate over a so-called iterable. This can be e.g. a
# list, dictionary, tuple, string, or function return (see yield statement
# later).

some_iterable = [1, 2, 'three', 4.0, None, 0]
for current_element in some_iterable:
    # This code block will be execute for each element in "some_iterable",
    # where "current_element" takes the value of the current element in the
    # iterable "some_iterable".
    print(current_element)

a = 0
print(f"Before loop: a is {a}")
for i in [1, 2, 3, 10]:
    a += i
    print(f"Current value for i is {i}")
    print(f"Current value for a is {a}")
print(f"After loop: a is {a}")

# If you want to iterate over iterable elements and get the number of the
# current loop iteration, you can use the enumerate() function.
for iteration, current_element in enumerate(range(5, 10)):
    print("loop iteration: {} element: {}".format(iteration, current_element))

# If you want to iterate over two iterables simultaneously, you can either
# iterate over the indices:
for s in range(len("test")):
    print('test'[s] == "nest"[s])

# Or you can use zip() to combine the iterables:
for s1, s2 in zip('test', '123456'):
    print(s1 == s2)

# Important: Changing the content of the iterable while you iterate over it
# is tricky and might lead to unintended results. Use a copy of the iterable
# instead, if want to modify it during the loop.

# Tricky and potentially unsafe:
# some_iterable = list(range(10))
# for element in some_iterable:
#     print(element)
#     del some_iterable[0]


###############################################################################
# while loops
###############################################################################
# While loops continue as long as the condition is True:
i = 0
while i < 10:
    print(i)
    i += 1

# This would not be executed:
i = 0
while i < 0:
    print(i)
    i += 1

# This would run forever:
# i = 0.
# while True:
#     print(i)
#     i += 1.


###############################################################################
# break, continue, and else
###############################################################################
# The break and continue keywords can be used to either escape the loop or to
# jump to the next element
for i in range(10):
    if i == 4:
        continue
    elif i == 8:
        break
    print(i)

# The else keyword put after a loop has a special meaning in Python. It will
# only get executed if the loop has finished properly, i.e. the for loop
# iterable was exhausted or the while condition was False.
for i in range(5):
    if i == 3:
        break
    print(i)
else:
    print("Made it to the end!")


###############################################################################
# list comprehensions
###############################################################################
# List comprehensions are a fast(er) and compact way to write loops and
# conditions applied to an iterable.
# List comprehensions with () will be evaluated dynamically, list
# comprehensions with [] will immediately generate a full list.
# The syntax is: [code-block-in-loop for current_element in iterable]
old_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
new_dynamic_iterable = (str(i) for i in old_list)
new_list = [str(i) for i in old_list]
# This returns the same results as:
new_list = []
for i in old_list:
    new_list.append(str(i))
    

# You can use an if statement at the end of a list comprehension to execute
# the code-block in the loop conditionally. Note that there is no element
# appended to the list if the condition is not True:
new_list = [str(i) for i in old_list if i < 3]
# This returns the same results as:
new_list = []
for i in old_list:
    if i < 3:
        new_list.append(str(i))

# You can also use if-else statements in the loop code-block:
new_list = [str(i) if (i < 5) else 'end' for i in old_list]
# This returns the same results as:
new_list = []
for i in old_list:
    if (i < 5):
        new_list.append(str(i))
    else:
        new_list.append('end')

# Something fancier:
new_list = [str(i) if (i > 1) and (i < 5) else 'start' if (i == 1) else 'end'
            for i in old_list]
# This returns the same results as:
new_list = []
for i in old_list:
    if (i > 1) and (i < 5):
        new_list.append(str(i))
    else:
        if (i == 1):
            new_list.append('start')
        else:
            new_list.append('end')

# You can iterate over indices and use multiple iterables in one list
# comprehension:
old_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
old_list2 = list(range(5))

new_list = [old_list[i] + old_list2[i] for i in range(len(old_list))]

# You may also use zip() to combine 2 lists
new_list = [a + b for a, b in zip(old_list, old_list2)]

# You can even nest list comprehensions:
old_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
new_list = [str(element) for current_tuple in zip(old_list, old_list[::-1]) for element in current_tuple]
# This returns the same results as:
new_list = []
for current_tuple in zip(old_list, old_list[::-1]):
    for element in current_tuple:
        new_list.append(str(element))
