# Excursion: Decorators
###############################################################################
# Python supports the use of "decorators", which provide a more condense way
# of wrapping functions by other functions or classes. Decorators are just
# alternative syntax, so you do not need to use them. However, the numba
# package provides handy decorators, so we will cover the basics here.


# Let's assume we have a function original_f(a)...
def original_f(a):
    print(a)
    

# ... and we want to wrap this function by a another function wrapper_f().
def wrapper_f(function_to_wrap):
    """This function will return a wrapped version of function_to_wrap"""
    def wrapped_f():
        """This function is the wrapped version of function_to_wrap"""
        return function_to_wrap(5)
    print(f"Wrapping {function_to_wrap} to function with default argument 5")
    return wrapped_f  # return wrapped function


# We could wrap original_f by wrapper_f like this:
original_f = wrapper_f(original_f)
original_f()


# Decorator achieve the same behavior using a different syntax:
def original_f(a):
    print(a)


@wrapper_f  # this is a decorator
def original_f(a):
    print(a)

original_f()


# So
#
# def original_f(a):
#     print(a)
# original_f = wrapper_f(original_f)
#
# is equivalent to
#
# @wrapper_f
# def original_f(a):
#     print(a)


# Decorators can become quite complex and powerful, when used with classes
# instead of functions. There are many different supported syntax versions for
# decorators. For more information on the advanced usage of decorators see
# https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0318/

# Performance in Python: General hints
###############################################################################
# Pure Python code is interpreted code and therefore typically very slow,
# which especially concerns Python loops. To write fast/efficient code in
# Python, one can use Python modules that provide efficient implementations.
# For example, Numpy, pandas, and similar modules are highly optimized and
# -in most cases- fast when their functions are used.
# However, not every operation is covered by these modules and this is where
# performance optimization modules like Cython, numba, theano, TensorFlow,
# and PyTorch can help.
# theano, TensorFlow, and PyTorch are of special importance in
# Machine Learning, so we will learn about them in a dedicated Unit.
# IMPORTANT: In case your code is slow, you should first set some timers to
# locate the parts in your code that actually decrease performance. Then you
# can try to solve these operations via numpy or other packages.


###############################################################################
# Cython
###############################################################################
# The Cython module offers the possibility to write C or pseudo-C in Python. As
# numba is -in my opinion but that is subjective- closer to Python code, I will
# refer to the Cython homepage at this point. Performance-wise, Cython and
# numba are at par, depending on the individual use-cases.
# Homepage: http://cython.org/
# Comparison Cython/Numba:

###############################################################################
# Numba
###############################################################################
# The numba module utilizes the just-in-time (jit) compiler to speed up your
# Python code. It does so via decorators, that allow you to use different
# levels of optimization for CPU or GPU.

# Slow Python version

# Let us assume we have a function with a Python for-loop (=slow)

    """Some Python function we want to optimize"""

    for a in range(int(1e6)):

    _ = python_function()
native_python = (time.clock() - start) / 10
print("time for Python version: {}".format(native_python))


#
# Similar numpy version
#

# We could write this as numpy operations but it would require more memory
# (because range() is a generator and np.arange() instantly creates the whole array):

    _ = np.sum(np.arange(int(1e6)))

#
# Simple numba usage scenario (might not yield performance gain)
#

# Use the jit decorator provided by numba to optimize your function. You
# do not need to worry about Python datatypes and objects, numba supports
# almost anything in this mode. BUT: numba can not make full usage of
# optimization (it still needs to deal with dynamic typing etc.) and
# might actually fall back to native Python ('object mode') in some cases.

#
# Advanced numba usage scenario (some restriction but better performance)
#

# To get better optimization, you may use the jit decorator provided by numba
# while explicitly specifying the datatypes and avoiding some Python functions
# (e.g. dicts).
# You may set nopython=True to True to disable falling back to the potentially
# slow 'object mode'.
# Syntax: @jit(return_type(arg_type, arg_type, ...), nopython=True)
# More details: https://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/dev/user/jit.html

# Working with arrays in numba

# number of dimensions, e.g. float32[:,:], for a float32 numpy array with
# 2 dimensions.

        for y in range(array.shape[1]):
            # Using numba in nopython mode -> for loops are fast
            prod = array[x, y] * array[y, x]
            if prod >= 50:
                # We remember from previous Units that accessing a mutable
                # object via indices changes the array we passed to the
                # function:
                array[x, y] = 0.


_ = python_function(array=my_array)
print(my_array)

# You can view the compiled code as assembly code using
_ = [print(code) for code in python_function.inspect_asm().values()]
